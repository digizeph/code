We learnt how to write a routers for your [Rust Full Stack] web app with [How to use routers in Rust Frontend] before.

In this post, you will learn how to serve static files with [Rust Rocket] framework. You will have minimum website structure to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images etc with it.

You will also learn how to deploy a single page app and use template engine [Tera] in the following [Rust blog posts].

The contents of these post will be for the beginners of Rust language. So if you just want the complete Rust web project, please refer to [Rust Full Stack] and its **before** folders.

<br />

<h2 class="red-white">[Prerequisite]</h2>

1. [How to install Rust]
2. [Rocket Getting Started]
3. [How to deploy Rust Web App]
4. [How to use React Spring to animate your message]

---

I want you already have Rust installed in your machine. The blog post [How to install Rust] will help you for that. Then, setup development environment for [Rust Rocket]. [Rocket Getting Started] from the author will help you.

You can use other Rust web framework such as [actix]. The important point here is to learn the workflow so it is your choice.

The result of this post will be similar to [How to use React Spring to animate your message]. It won't be the exactly same but you can refer to it first if you are familiar with React.

When you want to deploy your Rust website later. Refer to [How to deploy Rust Web App].

If you are reading this post at [Steadylearner], there will be no better example for that.

<br />

<h2 class="blue">Table of Contents</h2>

2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Rust Rocket routes to serve them
5. Conclusion

---

You can only read **Rust Rocket to serve them** part if you already have static files read and how to structure them.

<br />

## 1. HTML

To prepare those static files is not Rust specific problem. Therefore, we will build them first. We will start with **index.html**. You should have followed [Rocket Getting Started] before you read on.

It will be similar to

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" >
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" >
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" >
    <meta name="author" content="www.steadylearner.com" >
    <title>Rust Website with static files</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="/static/steadylearner_favicon.png"> <!-- 1. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/main.css" > <!-- 2. -->
</head>

<body>
    <h1
        id="message"
        class="center-percent-absolute hover hover--red cursor-pointer transition--default font-two"
    >
        You know what? <!-- 3. -->
    </h1>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/main.js"></script> <!-- 3. -->
</body>
</html>
```

Nothing complicated things here. Your **index.html** file will be linker for all other files you will made.

1. This will be your favicon for your website. It will also show you can serve images for your Rust backend website.

2. It will help you visually decorate your html elements. You will have it later.

3. You will use JavaScript to show your true message instead of it.

That was all for your **index.html**.

<br />

## 2. CSS

You can see that there is **class="center-percent-absolute"** for CSS. We will write CSS for that and the other message we will make with JavaScript later.

Your **main.css file** will be similar to

```css
html, body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  font-family: helvetica;
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

.font-normal {
  font-size: 1.6rem;
}

/* 1. */
.center-percent-absolute {
  position: absolute;
  margin: 0;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

/* 2. */
.transition--default {
  transition: 1s;
}

.hover:hover {
  opacity: 0.8;
}

.hover--red:hover {
  color: #ff7676;
}

.cursor-pointer {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

You can use **1.** to centerize HTML elements on your device wherever they are. **2.** is just for visual effects when you user put cursor on your message.

You can use your CSS instead.

<br />

## 3. JavaScript

For our purpose is just to show you can serve static files, we will need just a few lines of JavaScript.

You can write main.js file similar to

```javascript
const message = document.getElementById("message");

message.onclick = () => { alert("I love You ðŸ’—") };
```

and it will show your true message when a user click the html element with id "message".

We already have all our HTML, CSS, JavaScript file ready.

You could test them without server side framework if you use path to serve **main.css** and **main.js** without /static/ prefix in **index.html**.

It will be similar to this.

[![react-easy-md-example](https://www.steadylearner.com/static/images/post/web/rust-static-files.png)](https://www.steadylearner.com/static/images/post/web/rust-static-files.png)

<br />

## 4. Rust Rocket routes to serve them

We don't need many dependencies to make [Rust Rocket] work. If you already have Cargo installed in your machine, you can use **$cargo new --bin staitc_files**.

Then, edit **Cargo.toml** in your folder similar to this

```toml
[package]
name = 'static_files_react_tera_with_rust'
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["www.steadylearner.com"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
rocket = "0.4.2"
```

You can think that it is similar to **package.json** if you are familiar with JavaScript.

Then, we will edit **main.rs** file first in your **src** folder.

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

// 1.
use crate::routes::{ static_files, get };
mod routes;

fn rocket() -> rocket::Rocket {
    rocket::ignite()
        .mount(
            "/",
            // 2.
            routes![
                static_files::file,
                get::index,
            ],
        )
}

fn main() {
    rocket().launch();
}
```

**1.** is used to import the **routes** we will build later.

If you are confused and not familiar with Rust yet, please refer to [Rust Rocket] documenation and read [How to modulize your Rust Frontend] and other [Rust blog posts].

**2.** is the payload of your Rust Rocket app. What you need is just to include those routes you will make inside routes! macro.

Later, we will use **$cargo run** or **cargo run --release** to compile the result binary file and server your files with the framework.

It will show you the same result at your browser if you tested it manually in the previous part.

Then, we need to make those routes in **routes** folder and will be easy.

First, you need **mod.rs** file to represent the **routes** folder.

It will be similar to

```rust
pub mod get;
pub mod static_files;
```

and nothing special here. You can see that Rust want you to be explicit when you export modules also with **pub mod**.

Then, write **get.rs**

```rust
use std::io;
use rocket::response::{NamedFile}; // 1.

#[get("/")]
pub fn index() -> io::Result<NamedFile> {
    NamedFile::open("static/index.html") // 2.
}
```

1. You can see that **NamedFile** API is used here. You will need it whenever you want to serve static files.

2. The **"static/index.html"** is used because you don't have to make routes for each file after you write code for **static_files.rs**.

It will be similar to

```rust
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use rocket::response::NamedFile;

#[get("/static/<file..>")]
pub fn file(file: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {
    NamedFile::open(Path::new("static/").join(file)).ok()
}
```

and you can compare it with **2.** in **get.rs**.

The author of [Rust Rocket] and its contributors already made [the way to simplify the process](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket_contrib/serve/struct.StaticFiles.html). You may use it instead and use **public** etc instead of **static** here.

You have all the files for your Rust project to serve static files.

What you need is to move all of them (index.html, main.css, main.js, favicon.png) inside your **static** folder.

Then, use **cargo run** to debug or **cargo run --release** for production to verify the result.

You will see the message with link you can visit after long wait.

Then, verify that you could serve static files easily with Rust

1. HTML with **You know what?**

2. CSS for it is centered

3. JavaScript because it show other message when you click

4. Image with **favicon.png** served along with the title of your index.html

<br />

## 5. Conclusion

I hope it was helpful for you to start your Rust web project. You could learn how to serve static files with **Rust**.

You can apply the same process to serve result files form Rust or JavaScript frontend framework because they are just static files.

We already learnt [how to do that with Rust][Fullstack Rust with Yew] before. I will write blog post for JavaScript later to help you.
